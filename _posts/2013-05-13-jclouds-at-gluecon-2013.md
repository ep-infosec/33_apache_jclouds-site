[Everett Toews](https://twitter.com/everett_toews) is hitting the road, getting some hands on keyboards, and really teaching developers how to use jclouds. He'll be giving a workshop titled *"Solve the Cross-Cloud Conundrum with jclouds"* at [Gluecon](http://www.gluecon.com/2013/) this year. The session is on May 22 from 10:30 to 11:30 am in Breakout 2.

## Gluecon

What is Gluecon? In their own words:

>*Cloud, Mobile, APIs, Big Data - all of the converging, important trends in technology today share one thing in common: developers.*

>*Developers are the vanguard. Developers are building in the cloud, building mobile applications, utilizing and building APIs, and working with big data. At the end of the day, developers are the core.*

This session will get developers doing what they do best. The workshop includes an overview of jclouds, its terminology, and its community then it quickly gets down to development. First, we'll install jclouds for use on the command line during the workshop. Then we'll work through an example of using jclouds to start virtual machines in multiple clouds. Rackspace will be offering free cloud trial accounts to the attendees of this session. It's their way of helping you get started in the cloud and say thanks for coming out.

## Conclusion

The reason to use jclouds is to control your cloud infrastructure with Java. In this workshop Everett be showing you exactly how to do that.
