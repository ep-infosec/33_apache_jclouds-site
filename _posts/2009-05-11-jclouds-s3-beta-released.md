jclouds provides any-weight clouds tools for Java 5 and later: you choose the depth you want. We are pleased to announce our first beta of *jclouds-s3*. *jclouds-s3* provides both *Map<String,InputStream>* and *FutureCommand* interfaces to [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

It features a pluggable core, most notably supporting Apache HttpNio and [Google App Engine for Java](http://code.google.com/appengine/) runtimes.

Please have a look at our project page and give it a try. We welcome your feedback and participation.
