## <a id="knownissues"></a> Known Issues

There are a number of open JIRA issues related to OpenStack endpoint and API version support: [JCLOUDS-114](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS-114), [JCLOUDS-773](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS-773) and [JCLOUDS-1197](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS-1197).
