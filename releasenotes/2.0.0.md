## <a id="intro"></a>Introduction

Apache jclouds 2.0 represents a significant milestone for the project. We are proud to support all major cloud providers in the marketplace with a mature, stable, codebase that is ready for production. You can [read the official announcement here](https://s.apache.org/NbYK). To get started with jclouds, please see the [jclouds installation guide](/start/install/).

## <a id="highlights"></a>Release Highlights

Apache jclouds 2.0 features include:

* Wider compatibility with the Guava and Guice libraries.
* Configuration of arbitrary hardware values in the compute abstraction.
* Many additions to the blobstore portable abstraction.
* Added support for new compute providers:
  * Microsoft Azure Resource Manager
  * ProfitBricks v3
  * OneAndOne
* Added support for new blob store providers:
  * Backblaze B2
* Better integration with OSGi and Apache Karaf.
* Numerous bug fixes and performance improvements.

The complete list of fixed issues and improvements can be found [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12327379&styleName=Html&projectId=12314430).

We have also improved [our CI system](https://jclouds.ci.cloudbees.com) by adding compatibility builds with the core libraries and OSGi framework, and by adding weekly builds that run the live tests. Check it out!

## <a id="computeimprovements"></a>Compute Improvements

* Added support for Microsoft Azure ARM, ProfitBricks v3 and OneAndOne.
* Configuration of arbitrary hardware values (CPU, memory and disk space) in the compute abstraction. [Read more](/blog/2016/08/22/arbitrary-cpu-ram/) about this useful feature developed as part of a GSoC 2016 project!
* Added `ap-northeast-2` (Seoul) and `ap-south-1` (Mumbai) regions to AWS.
* Implemented the compute abstraction in CloudSigma v2.
* Added the `cloudsigma2-mia` (Miami) region to CloudSigma v2.
* Promoted Docker and OAuth APIs to the main repo. The *groupId* for their respective dependencies changes to `org.apache.jclouds.api`.
* Promoted Google Compute Engine and ProfitBricks providers to the main repo. The *groupId* for their respective dependencies changes to `org.apache.jclouds.provider`.


## <a id="blobstoreimprovements"></a>BlobStore Improvements

* Added support for the Backblaze B2 API.
* Removed legacy swift API (superseded by openstack-swift).
* Removed discontinued hpcloud-objectstorage provider.
* Revamped multi-part upload, including listing contents and aborting operations.
* Support for server-side copying of blobs.
* Support for listing blobs via prefix and delimiter.
* Support modification and retrieval of container and blob ACLs.
* Cleaned up percent encoding, enabling use of non-ASCII characters.

## <a id="knownissues"></a> Known Issues

* The JSON credentials file used in Google Cloud cannot be used in the jclouds CLI for Google Cloud Storage and for Google Compute Engine, when using a reusable compute service.
