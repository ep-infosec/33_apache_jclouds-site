## Introduction

jclouds version 1.6.3 is the first release of jclouds as an Apache TLP, after two releases as part of the Apache Incubator.

You can read the official announcement at [Apache jclouds 1.6.3 released](http://apache.markmail.org/thread/4ppbqyu6ydmacrb3). You can read the details of the specific JIRA issues addressed in this release at the [JIRA Release Notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12324789&styleName=Html&projectId=12314430).

To get jclouds, please see the [jclouds installation guide](/start/install).

## Reminder

As per [1.6.1-incubating](../1.6.1), the jclouds Maven group ID has changed from org.jclouds to org.apache.jclouds so a pom.xml dependency would now look like:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.jclouds</groupId>
    <artifactId>jclouds-all</artifactId>
    <version>1.6.3</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
{% endhighlight %}
