## Introduction

jclouds version 1.7.0 is the first major release of jclouds as an Apache TLP, and the second release of jclouds as a TLP overall.

You can read the official announcement at [Apache jclouds 1.7.0 released](http://markmail.org/thread/djp4qs5vlutmcuxe). You can read the details of the specific JIRA issues addressed in this release at the [JIRA Release Notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12324405&styleName=Html&projectId=12314430).

To get jclouds, please see the [jclouds installation guide](/start/install/).

## Notes

* jclouds 1.7.0 is incompatible with [Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) 16. Please switch to
Guava 15.0 or earlier, or wait for jclouds 1.7.1

## Reminder

As per [1.6.1-incubating](../1.6.1), the jclouds Maven group ID has changed from org.jclouds to org.apache.jclouds so a pom.xml dependency would now look like:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.jclouds</groupId>
    <artifactId>jclouds-all</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
{% endhighlight %}
