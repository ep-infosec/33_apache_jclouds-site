## Introduction

jclouds version 1.7.1 is the third release of jclouds as an Apache TLP.

You can read the official announcement at [Apache jclouds 1.7.1 released](http://markmail.org/message/wvskzm356n2mraif). You can read the details of the specific JIRA issues addressed in this release at the [JIRA Release Notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS/fixforversion/12325588).

To get jclouds, please see the [jclouds installation guide](/start/install/).

## Notable updates

* A workaround for [JCLOUDS-427](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS-427) is provided to make jclouds compatible with JRE 1.7.0\_51-b13.
* Added the [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) compute provider. It is available in labs under the following Maven coordinates:
{% highlight xml %}
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.jclouds.labs</groupId>
    <artifactId>digitalocean</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.1</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
{% endhighlight %}
* Upgraded Bouncycastle to version 1.49.
* Added an HTTP driver based on the [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) library for efficient HTTP connections.
* Added support for PATCH methods that have a body.
* Allow configuring of networks to which the nodes will be attached directly from the portable [Compute](/start/compute) interface.

## Notes

* jclouds 1.7.1 is incompatible with [Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) 16. Please switch to
Guava 15.0 or earlier, or wait for jclouds 1.8.

## Reminder

As per [1.6.1-incubating](../1.6.1), the jclouds Maven group ID has changed from org.jclouds to org.apache.jclouds so a pom.xml dependency would now look like:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.jclouds</groupId>
    <artifactId>jclouds-all</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.1</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
{% endhighlight %}
